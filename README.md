Write a program that emulates a game of WAR.

Given a deck of cards (4 suits from 2 to Ace), two computer "players" each draw a card from the deck. The higher card wins, and the winner scores a point. In the event of a draw, the higher suit wins (from lowest to highest, clubs, spades, diamonds, hearts). For each round played, a message should be printed to the console, indicating the round number, who drew what cards, who won the match, and the running score. Once all the cards in the deck are exhausted, print the final score and a congratulatory message for the winner.

e.g.

```
Round 1
Player 1 draws the Two of Diamonds.
Player 2 draws the Queen of Hearts.

Player 2 wins Round 1!

Score
Player 1: 1
Player 2: 0

(... etc)

GAME OVER

FINAL SCORE
Player 1: 25
Player 2: 1

CONGRATULATIONS PLAYER 1!
